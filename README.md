MATLAB program to visualize simulations of firefly model by Ermentrout and Rinzel (1984) for teaching purposes.

The ODEs are given by $$\frac{d\theta_1}{dt}=\Omega$$ and $$\frac{d\theta_2}{dt} = \omega + A\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2)$$, where $$A>0$$.

$$\omega$$ is fixed, and $$\Omega$$ and $$A$$ can be adjusted with a slider.
